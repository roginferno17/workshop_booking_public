## What It Does

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10 or 3.11** (Python 3.12+ is not supported by this dependency set)
- pip (latest recommended)
- Git (any recent version)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishlazybuilds-commits/workshop_booking_public.git
cd workshop_booking_public
```

---

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Windows (Command Prompt)**
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt once active.

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you already have a virtual environment with Django 5.x, force-reinstall the pinned dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages installed:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Django>=3.2,<4` | Web framework |
| `pandas` | Data processing for analytics |
| `python-decouple>=3.3` | Environment variable management |
| `django-recurrence==1.11.1` | Recurring event support |
| `coverage` | Test coverage reporting |

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the sample env file:

```bash
cp .sampleenv .env
```

For local development, the defaults work out of the box:

```env
DB_ENGINE=sqlite3
DB_NAME=db.sqlite3
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=
```

Edit `local_settings.py` with email credentials (placeholder values are fine for local dev since emails print to the console by default):

```python
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = '587'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your@email.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
SENDER_EMAIL = 'your@email.com'
```

---

### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### 6. Create a Superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.

---

### 7. Seed the Guest Demo User *(Recommended)*

```bash
python manage.py seed_guest
```

This creates a ready-to-use demo account pre-loaded with sample data:

| | |
|---|---|
| Username | `guest` |
| Password | `fossee@guest` |

What gets seeded:
- A guest coordinator profile, fully filled out
- 3 Workshop Types (Python, Scilab, DWSIM)
- 5 sample workshops with mixed Accepted/Pending statuses

Safe to run multiple times — it resets only the guest user and their workshops.

---

### 8. Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

| URL | Page |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:8000/` | Landing page |
| `http://localhost:8000/workshop/login/` | Sign in |
| `http://localhost:8000/admin/` | Django admin panel |

---

### 9. Initial Admin Setup

1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials
2. Under **Authentication and Authorization → Groups**, create a group called `instructor`
3. Assign **all permissions** to the `instructor` group
4. New users are coordinators by default. To promote a user to instructor:
   - Set their profile `position` to `instructor`
   - Add them to the `instructor` group

## Design System — Playful Geometric

The frontend uses a custom design system with no external CSS frameworks.

- **Design Tokens** — Centralized CSS variables for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows
- **Custom Dropdowns** — `<select>` elements auto-converted into styled comboboxes, pill selectors, and typeahead inputs
- **Card Grids** — Clickable icon cards replacing dropdowns for better UX
- **Page Transitions** — Full-screen wipe animations between auth pages
- **Video Backgrounds** — Looping geometric animation on sign-in/sign-up panels
- **Responsive Layout** — Mobile-first grids that collapse gracefully on small screens

| Component | Variants |
|---|---|
| `pg-dropdown` | `default`, `combobox`, `pills`, `typeahead` |
| Buttons | `btn-candy` (primary), `btn-outline` (secondary) |
| Cards | `card-sticker` with pop shadows |
| Animations | `slide-up`, `pop-in`, `float`, `wiggle`, `spin-slow` |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'decouple'` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside your venv |
| `ImportError` from `local_settings` | Ensure `local_settings.py` exists in the project root |
| Database errors after model changes | Run `makemigrations` then `migrate` |
| `(venv)` not showing in terminal | Virtual environment isn't active — re-run the activate command |
| Port 8000 already in use | Use `python manage.py runserver 8080` |
| Static files not loading | Run `python manage.py collectstatic` |
